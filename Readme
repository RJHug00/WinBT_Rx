This Powershell script encapsulates tasks needed to run Windows' bluetooth file transfer wizard (fsquirt) in receive mode. This will either acquire a file already in-transit from the likes of a cell phone, or a file whose transmission from such a device will be started subsequently (e.g. from a 'share' button on the phone).  Note: it is hardwired for RECEIVE only.

Of greatest interest, the script turns on the bluetooth radio if it is not already on, and turns it off upon completion.

THe script has some dependencies on the way it is invoked, and pretty much presumes it is started from a Windows shortcut (I keep my shortcut in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs)

  On the shortcut's SHORTCUT tab:
    - Target: <path to PS>\powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive
                                          -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File <path to script>\BTRx.ps1
      [remembering the PS options is one reason to launch via shortcut]

    - Start In: C:\Users\<user>\Downloads
      [optional; streamlines the user interaction, but fsquirt allows ad-hoc modification]

    - Run: Normal Window or Minimized

    - Click "Advanced" button and ensure 'Run as administrator' is checked.
      [One of the main reasons starting from a shortcut is recommended]

Good Bluetooth-ing!
